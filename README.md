# Project Description

The Online Hostel seat Booking System helps in booking the seats in the hostels. This also helps in keeping details of the hostellers and applied students. It will simplify the work of the institutions in getting the seats booked in the hostels with great ease. This system is designed to support the hostel management which helps them to save the records of the students about their rooms and vacant rooms in the hostel.

# Advantages

**Automation** - It saves them from the tons of manual work from which it is very difficult to find the record of the students and the information of about the those who had left the hostel years ago.

**Well-Organized** - This will help in maintaining the seats present in the hostels in a well organized way.

**Transparency** - The system maintains Transparency between the students and the college.

# Problem Statement

There are a lot of drawbacks in keeping and maintaining a hostel. Especially with a manual system. Since most hostels are being run by only one hostel manager, the number of students in a room are sometimes not known by the officer. He has to go room by room to ensure that a room is occupied or not. Hostel Fees or fines may be due for some students and they are saved on papers or huge notebooks, and sometimes receipts. If the books go missing or stolen, one would never be able to know if a student is owing or not. Room allocation also becomes a problem as the officer might not know which rooms are available or not. And some hostels have a lot of rooms or have mare storeys and it would be very tedious to go through all storeys in search of a free room for an applicant. Also, the officer might not know the number of students in a room or know if a room is full or not.

Moreover, After the Covid outbreak, when the students will return back to campus, It will be a very difficult task to allot rooms manually to all the students which will definitely cause huge mismanagement. So, it is utmost important to have such an onlune system int every institution to maintain the records of all the resides in the various hostels.
